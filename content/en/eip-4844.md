title: Shard Blob Transactions

## Abstract

Introduce a new transaction format for “blob-carrying transactions” which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. The format is intended to be fully compatible with the format that will be used in full sharding.

## ChatGPT4

The proposal of EIP-4844 is to introduce a new transaction format for "blob-carrying transactions" which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. This format is intended to be fully compatible with the format that will be used in full sharding, and it aims to scale data-availability of Ethereum in a simple, forwards-compatible manner.
